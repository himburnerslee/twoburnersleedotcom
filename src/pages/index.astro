			I wouldn't be a real dev if I didn't have my very own blog that I never
			updated, would I? This blog is inspired by the #LearnInPublic and
			#BlackTechTwitter hashtags.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			I'm a Black Software Developer, not very good, and this is now my latest
			of many, many attempts to get better. I figure if I make a blog and
			announce to the world that I'm learning in public, perhaps I'll actually
			stick with trying to improve.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4">
			This is a test to see if all this stuff is working. I'll be back later
			once I think through all this. But I got email #1 from Monica Lent's
			course "Blogging for Devs" so figured maybe I can at least keep cadence
			with that and get started today. See ya later.
